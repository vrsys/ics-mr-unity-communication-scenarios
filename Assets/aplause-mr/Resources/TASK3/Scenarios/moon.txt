You are a member of a space crew originally scheduled to rendezvous with a mother ship on the lighted surface of the moon. However, due to mechanical difficulties, your ship was forced to land at a spot some 200 miles from the rendezvous point. In addition to your space suit, your crew has managed to save items left intact and undamaged after landing. Your task is to take the items which allow you to reach the mother ship.
