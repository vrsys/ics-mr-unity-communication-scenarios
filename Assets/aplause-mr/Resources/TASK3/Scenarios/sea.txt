You are drifting in a private yacht in the South Pacific. A fire with unknown origin has destroyed much of the yacht, notably navigational and radio equipment. After having controlled the fire, you realize that the boat is sinking little by little. Your best estimate is that you are many hundreds of miles from the nearest landfall. You and your friends have managed to save 15 items, undamaged and intact after the fire. In addition, you have salvaged a four man rubber life craft and a box of matches.
